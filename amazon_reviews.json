                        "rev_text": "I have purchased this product after lot of research.This is my first AC. I'm very happy with this purchase. Cooling is good but it takes around 20 to 30 minutes to cool the room (120 sq.ft). Once the room is cool you don't have to do anything the AI (AC) mode takes care of the rest.  Installation was ok but it was not so professional as it was from Jeeves and not from LG. Also there was no safety measures given or taken for the installation guys. They just hang in the 12th floor window outlet without even a rope which is very dangerous. Amazon has to take care of these safety measures for sure.Pros :1. Energy efficient2. AI (AC) mode is very good as it's keeps up the temparature and also manages the electricity consumption3. 6 in 1 covertable option is also fine. But not sure how effective it is. Will again write on this based on my electricity consumption for next 4 months.4. This has 4 way swing which is very useful.5. Sound it lessCons:1. It takes longer time to cool the entire room2. No lights on the remote, it's very hard to operate during night times if we have elders at home3. Should clean the filter often which is not a good option4. Installation should be done with safety measures which is not followed here5. Demo process did not happen after installation6. It's actually 1.31 ton AC but sold as 1.5 ton AC that's the reason it's taking longer time to cool7. Energy consumption in Viraat mode is too much so not advisableBut based on my reasearch if I want to get another AC, I will not go for LG as I see there are other better brands such as1. OGeneral2. Daikin3. HitachiBased on my budget I bought LG with some offers at 37k. Next time will go for OGeneral for sure."
